## Low-Level Design (LLD) Document

## 1. Data Preprocessing Module
- Removes index artifacts
- Converts date to datetime
- Sorts data by crypto name and time
- Handles missing values generated by rolling operations

---

## 2. Feature Engineering Module
- Log Returns
- Rolling Volatility (Target Variable)
- Volume-to-MarketCap Ratio
- Moving Average (14-day)
- Bollinger Band Width
- Average True Range (ATR)

Each feature is computed **per cryptocurrency** using grouped rolling windows.

---

## 3. Model Training Module
- Train-test split with `shuffle=False`
- Pipelines used for scale-sensitive models
- Tree-based models trained on raw features

---

## 4. Hyperparameter Tuning Module
- `RandomizedSearchCV`
- `TimeSeriesSplit` for cross-validation
- RMSE used as optimization metric

---

## 5. Deployment Module
- Final model retrained on full dataset
- Serialized using Pickle
- Loaded into Streamlit for inference-only usage
